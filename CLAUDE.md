# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with
code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Bitcoin Wallet Kit (bwk) - a modular Rust workspace providing components for
building Bitcoin wallets. Experimental, API unstable.

See [CODE_GUIDELINES.md](CODE_GUIDELINES.md) for code style rules.

## Build Commands

```bash
# Build release
cargo build --release

# Run all tests (requires the test feature; sqlite gates its own test code)
cargo test --features test,sqlite

# Run tests with output
cargo test --features test,sqlite -- --nocapture

# Single test
cargo test --features test,sqlite <test_name>

# Lint
cargo clippy --all-targets --features test,sqlite -- -D warnings
cargo fmt --all -- --check
```

MSRV: 1.88

**Before committing:** run `scripts/ci-checks.sh`. It is the single definition
of green for this repo (fmt check, clippy, tests, release build, in that
order), and every CI job runs a section of it; pass a section name to run just
one, e.g. `scripts/ci-checks.sh clippy`. Commit messages must be single-line
and follow existing style (e.g., `crate: short description`).

## Architecture

### Standard Wallet (`bwk`)
```
Account (bwk/src/account.rs)
├── ElectrumScanner (bwk-electrum, records what the server reports)
│   ├── CoinStore (UTXOs, derives addresses via SpkDerivator, and owns
│   │   the TxStore holding the raw txs and their inclusion state)
│   ├── LabelStore (user labels)
│   └── listener thread (its own Electrum connection)
├── HeaderFollower (holds the HeaderStore: validated header chain, two
│   Electrum connections of its own, one for the header worker and one
│   for the merkle-proof client, and keeps it on the scanner's endpoint)
├── SigningManager (hot signers)
└── Reconciler (bwk-electrum, its own thread: promotes what the scanner
    recorded against the header chain, verifies proofs)
```

The scanner and the header validator are independent and never talk to each
other: the scanner has no header store and never sees a merkle request or
response, and the validator never touches the coin stores. The `Reconciler`
pairs them, promoting `ConfirmedUnverified` to `Verified` and stamping
confirmation times through `ElectrumScanner::coin_store`.

### Silent Payments Wallet (`bwk-sp`)
```
Account (sp/src/account/mod.rs)
├── SpReceiver - SP key management and scan matching
├── Blindbit transport - blockchain data via Blindbit oracle
├── SpCoinStore, SpTxStore, ScanState (bwk-sp's own)
├── LabelStore (from bwk-electrum)
├── SP scanner thread (background block scanning)
├── ElectrumScanner per sub-account descriptor (bwk-electrum)
├── HeaderStore (validated header chain, shared by every scanner)
├── Reconciler per scanner (promotes its scan against the header chain)
└── SigningManager (hot signers for the sub-account descriptors)
```

### Transaction Building (`bwk-tx`)
```
TxBuilder
├── RecipientProvider trait - outputs (Recipient, SpRecipient, change providers)
├── CoinSource trait - input selection
├── coin_selection module - weighted random selection algorithm
└── TxTemplate -> Psbt via generate()
```

Key traits:
- `RecipientProvider`: Defines transaction outputs (address, amount, PSBT
  metadata)
- `CoinSource`: Provides spendable coins for selection
- `ChangeTip`: Manages change address index progression
- `Signer`: Signs PSBTs (implemented by HotSigner)

### Notification Pattern

Both Account types use `mpsc::channel<Notification>` for async events
(connection status, new coins, scan progress). Call `account.receiver()` to
take the receiver.

## Features

`bwk` gates optional behaviour behind cargo features, all off by default:
- `logger`: installs `env_logger` as the global logger. Off by default so a
  consumer with its own logger does not pull env_logger and its
  timestamp/colour stack.
- `sp`: silent-payments notification variants, used by `bwk-sp`.
- `hwi`: hardware wallet signers.
- `sqlite`: the SQLite persistence backend.
- `test`: see below.

## Testing

Integration tests require the `test` feature flag which enables:
- `bwk-electrum/test`: Test-only store constructors and accessors (synthetic
  header chains, tx-entry and validation-state setters)
- `bwk-utils/test`: Test helpers (funding_tx, corepc_node utilities, and the
  shared regtest harness in `utils/src/test/regtest.rs`)
- `bwk-sign/test`: Test signer constructors
- `bwk-tx/test`: TxBuilder test methods (fund_with_bitcoind, mark_tx_mined)
- `bwk-persist/test`: Test-only accessors on the backends (on-disk paths)
- `logger`: env_logger as the global logger, so tests get log output

Tests in `bwk/src/account.rs` and `electrum/tests/` use `electrsd` for regtest
Electrum integration, all through `bwk_utils::test::regtest`. Tests in
`sp/tests/` use `blindbitd` for regtest Blindbit integration.

## External Dependencies

- `spdk-core`, `spdk-wallet`, `backend-blindbit-v1`: optional comparison
  benchmark dependencies only (`bwk-sp/bench-spdk`)
- `miniscript`: Descriptor parsing and script generation
- `bitcoin`: Bitcoin primitives (v0.32)
