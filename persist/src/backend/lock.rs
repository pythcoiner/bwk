//! Per-datadir advisory file lock.
//!
//! [`JsonBackend`](super::JsonBackend) and
//! [`SqliteBackend`](super::SqliteBackend) acquire a [`DirLock`] at
//! open time so a second process (or a second in-process opener)
//! can't share the same account directory. Wallet state has exactly
//! one owner; racing scanners / tip updates / store flushes corrupt
//! invariants even when the byte-level I/O itself is atomic.
//! [`HeaderBackend`](super::HeaderBackend) reuses the same lock via a
//! per-file sentinel (`{file}.lock`) rather than the directory `.lock`,
//! since its cache file lives inside an account dir a `JsonBackend`
//! already locks.
//!
//! The lock is an OS-level advisory lock (`flock` on POSIX,
//! `LockFileEx` on Windows) on a sentinel file `{dir}/.lock`. The
//! kernel releases it automatically when the holding process exits,
//! so there is no stale-lock recovery path.
//!
//! The `.lock` filename is reserved; it starts with a dot and is
//! not a member of [`KNOWN_STORES`](crate::KNOWN_STORES), so
//! `validate_store_name` cannot collide with it.
